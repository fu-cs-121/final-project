# Final Project Examples

Below are three example final projects that demonstrate different types of applications and project structures. Each project includes a `readme.md` file that describes the project structure, program design, dataset (if applicable), setup instructions, and how to run the program.

You may clone these repositories (see instructions below) and run them on your local machine to explore the code and see how the projects are organized. You may also use these examples as inspiration for your own final project, but don't just copy the code; make sure to understand it and adapt it to your own needs.
